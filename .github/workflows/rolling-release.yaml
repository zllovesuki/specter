      # 1) Make sure 'edge' actually points at this SHA:
      - name: Check `edge` tag matches CI commit

        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

            const tag = await github.rest.git.getRef({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo:  context.repo.repo,
              ref:   'tags/edge'
            });
            const edgeSha = tag.data.object.sha;
            const ciSha   = context.payload.workflow_run.head_sha;
            if (edgeSha !== ciSha) {
              console.log(`⚠️ edge tag (${edgeSha}) ≠ CI commit (${ciSha}); skipping release.`);
              // exit 78 = neutral (job is skipped)
              process.exit(78);
            }
            console.log('✅ edge tag matches; proceeding with release.');

      # 2) Checkout the exact commit the CI tested:
